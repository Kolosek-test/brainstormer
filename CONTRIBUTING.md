If you have an idea for a feature, if you noticed a bug or ideas for how the readme could be improved (I think it could!) you are welcome to open an issue using github issues: https://github.com/LoneKP/brainstormer.online/issues

If you already have a solution to your problem in mind, feel free to create a pull request with your suggested changes. I will review it, and anything merged to the main branch in this repository will be deployed to brainstormer.online.
