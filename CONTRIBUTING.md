# How to contribute to Brainstormer?

## First... a little bit about the vision for open sourcing this project

Brainstomer is all about creating ideas together and making them happen. I would like to take that idea into this open source project as well!

My vision for open sourcing this project is to get the barrier for entry as low as possible. I would like to make it possible to contribute even if you don't have a technical background.
