  <p>The following text outlines the data footprint you leave by using Brainstormer, and how your data is treated and stored! I am dedicated to treating your data with respect and to only store what is necessary. If you have any questions about how your data is handled, don't hesitate to reach out.</p></br>

  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">Your data when using brainstormer as a guest</h3>
  <p>When you use brainstormer as a guest your <strong>IP address</strong> is saved. With your IP address you're letting me know from where in the world you are using Brainstormer, and learning the demographics of Brainstormer's users is the only reason I store your IP address. I store your IP address for maximum 1 month.</p></br>
  <p>When you choose to send your ideas by email at the end of the brainstorming session, <strong>your email address</strong> is saved in <a class="underline" href="https://mailtrap.io/">Mailtrap</a>, which is used to send out those emails.</p></br>
  <p>I will not use your email for anything at all besides sending you that one email with your generated ideas.</p></br>

  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">Your data when signing up for a user account</h3>
  <p>When you sign up for a user account, your <strong>name</strong> and <strong>email</strong> will be saved.</p></br>
  <p>Information about the <strong>time of your last sign in</strong> and your <strong>IP address</strong> when signing in will also be saved, to help me understand how you're using your account. I store your IP address for maximum 1 month.</p></br>
  <p>When you sign up for a user account you accept to occasionally receive emails from Brainstormer. It could be tips on how to use the product or special offers. You can go to <%= link_to "your notification settings", users_edit_notifications_path, class: "underline" %> and opt out any time.</p></br>

  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">Your data when signing up for a paid plan or a free trial</h3>
  <p>I use <a class="underline" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> to handle everything regarding paid plans, free trials and payment.</p></br>
  <p>When you sign up for a free trial or a paid plan, your <strong>name</strong>, <strong>email</strong>, <strong>encrypted credit card details</strong> and any other information you write, will be processed by Stripe.</p></br>
  <p>Feel free to <a class="underline" href="https://stripe.com/privacy">take a closer look at how Stripe handles data here.</a></p></br>


  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">Your usage data</h3>
  <p>I try to understand how you use Brainstormer, by tracking which buttons you click when you use Brainstormer. I do that only to understand how useful the features I built are to you. Based on what I learn, I try to come up with improvements and new features.</p></br>

  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">Generated ideas</h3>
  <p>Any brainstorms created by a facilitator on the hobbyist or facilitator plan are open to anyone who has the link, so I encourage you to not add any sensitive data in your ideas.</p></br>
  
  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">Where is your data stored?</h3>
  <p>I use Heroku to host the Brainstormer app. Heroku is, as you can read in their <a class="underline" href="https://www.heroku.com/policy/security" target="_blank">security policy</a>, committed to keeping customers' data safe.</p></br>

  <p>Brainstormer uses a Postgres database to store your IP address and your usage data. This database is hosted on Amazon Web Services on a data center located in Europe.</p></br>

  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">How to get in touch?</h3>
