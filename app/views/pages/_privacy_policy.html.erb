  <p>The following text outlines the data footprint you leave by using Brainstormer, and how your data is treated and stored! I am dedicated to treat your data with respect and to only store what is necessary. If you should have any questions or worries about how your data is handled, don't hesitate to reach out.</p></br>

  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">Your data when using brainstormer as a guest</h3>
  <p>When you use brainstormer your <strong>IP address</strong> is saved. With your IP address you’re letting me know from where in the world you are using Brainstormer, and learning the demographics of Brainstormer’s users is the only reason I store your IP address.</p></br>
  <p>When you choose to send your ideas by email at the end of the brainstorming session, <strong>your email address</strong> is saved as a contact on the Brainstormer Google Gmail, which is used to send out those emails.</p></br>
  <p>I will not use your email for anything at all besides sending you that one email with your generated ideas.</p></br>

  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">Your data when signing up for a user account</h3>
  <p>When you sign up for a user account, your <strong>name</strong> and <strong>email</strong> will be saved along with your encrypted password.</p></br>
  <p>Information about the <strong>time of your last sign in</strong> and you <strong>IP address</strong> when signing in will also be saved, to help me understand how you're using your account.</p></br>
  <p>Apart from that the same rules apply as when using Brainstormer as a guest.</p></br>

  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">Your usage data</h3>
  <p>I try to understand how you use Brainstormer, by tracking which buttons you click when you use Brainstormer. I do that only to understand how useful the features I built are to you. Based on what I learn, I try to come up with improvements and new features.</p></br>

  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">Generated ideas</h3>
  <p>Any brainstorms created by a facilitator on the hobbyist or facilitator plan are open to anyone who has the link, so I encourage you to not add any sensitive data in your ideas.</p></br>
  
  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">Where is your data stored?</h3>
  <p>I use Heroku to host the Brainstormer app. Heroku is, as you can read in their <a href="https://www.heroku.com/policy/security" target="_blank">security policy</a>, committed to keeping customers' data safe.</p></br>

  <p>Brainstormer uses a Postgres database to store your IP address temporarily and your usage data. This database is hosted on Amazon Web Services on a data center located in Europe.</p></br>

  <h3 class="text-5xl lg:text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed">How to get in touch</h3>
